  <h1>Big Project</h1>
  <p>Pitch: It is estimated that 2.4 million Californians will gain health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, through expanded Medi-Cal, or the state health insurance marketplace. But health experts say the population who will remain ineligible for health insurance even after Jan. 1 is nearly double that — up to 4 million people. Three-quarters of those left out of health reform will not be able to get covered because of their immigration status.


	<h3>News Angle</h3>
	<p>The Affordable Care Act goes into effect Jan. 1. Meanwhile, the president is pushing what arguably is his second biggest policy agenda — immigration reform. This map will look at the intersection of the two in California</p>
