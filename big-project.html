	<p>Pitch 1: A visualization showing where the biggest population of people left out of the Affordable Care Act -- undocumented immigrants -- are dispersed in California. Then look at what percentage is currently covered by somme sort of insurance like Medi-Cal or private insurance. Then look at how those without some sort of coverage get care. I think the data will show that most of it is emergency room care, which is the most expensive.</p>

	<p>Pitch2: Look at how many people in California will gain health insurance through Medi-Cal expansion. Also look at funding for the expansion, and how it will impact the expansion as money is reduced over time.</p>

	<p>Pitch 3: Compare how much San Francisco and Los Angeles spend on indigent care, also compare funding for other social programs like homelessness outreach. Incorportate other data like population and other demographic information.</p>
