  <h1>Dataviz Final Project</h1>

  <h2>The Pitch</h2>
  <p>Last year, on average, Major League baseball teams struck out more than at any time in its 112 year history. My project would be an interactive chart that shows the average strikeouts per year of every team in the Major Leagues for every year their franchise has been in existence. Ideally, this chart would be interactive, allowing readers to see the chart in the context of their favorite team.</p>

  <h3>News Angle</h3>
  <p>Because strikeouts have been increasing for several years there is no immediate news peg, but it could be published before the world series with a focus on how teams currently in the playoffs have been affected. If that doesn't work out, it could be published at the beginning of next year, as a preview for the next season, with more emphasis on how strategy might be changing for the coming season.</p>

  <h3>Sources</h3>
  <p>All the historical data is available on <a href="http://baseball-reference.com">baseball-reference.com</a>.</p>
  <p>I'd like to talk to a couple hitting coaches to see if they have recognized this difference and if they are telling their batters to hit differently than they did in the past. Chili Davis, the batting coach of the Oakland Athletics, would be ideal, but I've identified some minor league coaches as well.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>This subject has been written about before, but no news organization has visualized the distribution or, to my satisfaction, offered a significant answer to why it has been rising so steadily, even in the post-steroids era.</p>

  <h3>Publication</h3>
  <p>There are a number of stat-based sports sites that I could pitch this to, including the Baseball Prospectus blog, FanGraphs or more local sites, like the sports desks of the San Francisco Chronicle or the Oakland Tribune.</p>

  <h3>Preliminary Questions</h3>
  <p>Are all teams seeing a similar rise in strikeouts?</p>
  <p>Are hitters bein more aggressive, or are pitchers becoming more effective?</p>
  <p>Is this a real trend, or was there some rule change or change in statistic recording that accounts for the increase?</p>
