	<p>Pitch 1: A visualization showing where the biggest population of people left out of the Affordable Care Act -- undocumented immigrants -- are dispersed in California. Then look at what percentage is currently covered by somme sort of insurance like Medi-Cal or private insurance. Then look at how those without some sort of coverage get care. I think the data will show that most of it is emergency room care, which is the most expensive.</p>
